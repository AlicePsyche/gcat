Genome Comparison and Analysis Toolkit
Version 0.69

An adaptable and efficient toolkit for large-scale evolutionary comparative
genomics analysis. Written in the Perl programming language, GCAT utilizes 
the BioPerl, Perl EnsEMBL and R Statistics APIs.

Part of a PhD thesis entitled "Evolutionary Genomics of Organismal Diversity".

DOWNLOAD
--------

You can download from https://bitbucket.org/gawbul/gcat by clicking get source and downloading 
in the preferred format. We recommend zip for the purposes of the installation instructions in 
this document. You can also download from https://github.com/gawbul/gcat and click on the ZIP 
icon to download the source.

Additionally you can checkout the code from bitbucket using Mercurial by running

hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/gawbul/gcat

Or from github by running

git clone git://github.com/gawbul/gcat.git

INSTALLATION
------------

We recommend installing the toolkit on Ubuntu Linux version 10.04+ or OS X 10.5+, as these are
the machines it has been tested and developed on. Support for Windows is unlikely in the future.
Should you require running this software on a Windows machine, then we recommend downloading
VirtualBox from http://www.virtualbox.org and installing BioLinux or Ubuntu as a virtual machine.
We may make a virtual machine available with the software preconfigured in the future. 

To install from source you should simply extract the archive to an appropriate directory for 
example your home directory i.e. /home/stevemoss or /Users/stevemoss. The * in the following 
text represents the revision id e.g. daacf7a00ab8

	mv ~/Downloads/gawbul-gcat-*.zip ~/
	unzip gawbul-gcat-*.zip
	nano ~/.bashrc
	
	Add the following lines to your .bashrc (or .profile) file
	
	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/home/stevemoss/gawbul-gcat-*/modules
	export PERL5LIB
	
	You should also do the same for the location of the EnsEMBL Perl APIs e.g.

	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/home/stevemoss/ensembl/ensembl/modules
	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/home/stevemoss/ensembl/ensembl-compara/modules
	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/home/stevemoss/ensembl/ensembl-functgenomics/modules
	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/home/stevemoss/ensembl/ensembl-variation/modules
	export PERL5LIB

TESTING
-------

gawbul-gcat-*/t contains tests of the pipeline functionality. You can run the shell 
script do_tests.sh using

	sh do_tests.sh
	
to run all the tests currently implemented.


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------

After installing, you can find documentation for this module at the GCAT Wiki.

    https://bitbucket.org/gawbul/gcat/wiki/

You can report issues with the code at:

	https://bitbucket.org/gawbul/gcat/issues
	
The Wiki has been disabled at the github page, as bitbucket is the primary development 
repository. The github clone is provided for convenience, but provides the exact same 
functionality.
